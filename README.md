My attempt to pass Stanford's CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual recognition (Spring 2019).

## Assignment #1

The first homework is about building a simple image classification pipeline. It comprises implementations of the following things:

* k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Softmax Classifier
* Two-Layer Neural Network
* Higher Level Representations: Image Features

More detailed information can be found [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/).
